# Safety-Checklist-Website
This website was created at the CodeRED Odyssey Hackathon with 3 other collaborators. 
We designed this website to educate about important safety measures within the oil and gas industry, while providing company workers with a safety checklist for upstream, midstream, and downstream operations.
